    <h1>3 points regarding Tawheed</h1>
    <h2>Two meanings of Tawheed:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Linguistic Meaning: To single out something and make it one</li>
      <li>
        Islamic Meaning: To single out Allah in every matter which is exclusive
        to him, including; Allah's attributes of Lordship, Allah's right to
        Worship, Allah's Names and Attributes
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>3 points Regarding Tawheed</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Allah has created us, provideds for us, and he has not left us without a
        purpose, rather, Allah has sent to us a messenger. Whoever obeys him,
        will enter paradise and whoever disobeys him will enter the fire. <br />
        <em
          >The proof is the saying of Allah: {Indeed We have sent a messenger to
          be a witness over you, as We have sent a Messenger to the Pharaoh.
          However, the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger; so We seized him with a
          severe punishment} [73:15-16]</em
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Allah is not pleased that anyone associated with him in his worship; not
        a close angel nor a sent messenger, <br />
        <em s
          >proof to this is the saying of Allah; { وَأَنَّ ٱلْمَسَـٰجِدَ لِلَّهِ
          فَلَا تَدْعُوا۟ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ" أَحَدًا}</em
        >
        Meaning:
        <bold>
          The places of worship are ˹only˺ for Allah, so do not invoke anyone
          besides Him.</bold
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Whoever is obedient to the messenger and worships Allah upon Tawheed, it
        is not permissible for them to have love and alliance for those who
        oppose Allah and his messengers.<br />
        <em
          >Proof to this saying is; {لَّا تَجِدُ قَوْمًا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ
          وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْـَٔاخِرِ يُوَآدُّونَ مَنْ حَآدَّ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ
          وَلَوْ كَانُوٓا۟ ءَابَآءَهُمْ أَوْ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ أَوْ إِخْوَٰنَهُمْ
          أَوْ عَشِيرَتَهُمْ ۚ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ كَتَبَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلْإِيمَـٰنَ
          وَأَيَّدَهُم بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ ۖ وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّـٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن
          تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَـٰرُ خَـٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا ۚ رَضِىَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ
          وَرَضُوا۟ عَنْهُ ۚ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ حِزْبُ ٱللَّهِ ۚ أَلَآ إِنَّ حِزْبَ
          ٱللَّهِ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ}</em
        ><br />
        Meaning:
        <bold
          >You will never find a people who ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the
          Last Day loyal to those who defy Allah and His Messenger, even if they
          were their parents, children, siblings, or extended family. For those
          ˹believers˺, Allah has instilled faith in their hearts and
          strengthened them with a spirit from Him.1 He will admit them into
          Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever. Allah is
          pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of
          Allah. Indeed, Allah’s party is bound to succeed.</bold
