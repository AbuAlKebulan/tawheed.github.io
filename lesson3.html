    <ol>
      <li>
        Allah has created us, provideds for us, and he has not left us without a
        purpose, rather, Allah has sent to us a messenger. Whoever obeys him,
        will enter paradise and whoever disobeys him will enter the fire.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allah is not pleased that anyone associated with him in his worship; not
        a close angel nor a sent messenger, proof to this is <br>
        <em
          >وَأَنَّ ٱلْمَسَـٰجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا۟ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ"
          أَحَدًا</em
        >
        Meaning:

        <li>As a mercy to mankind</li>
