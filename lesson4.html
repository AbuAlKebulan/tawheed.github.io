      <h1>Importance of studying At-Tawheed</h1>
      <h2>Al-Haneefiyah is the religion of Ibraheem(عليه السلام)</h2>
      <h3>Two meanings of Al-Haneefiyah</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Linguistic Meaning: <em>To lean towards something</em></li>
        <li>
          Islamic Meaning:
          <em>
            It is the path which is far from shirk and upon Ikhlas, Tawheed and
            Imaan
          </em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Know, may Allah direct you to obey Him, Al-Haneefiyyah, (1) the way of
        Ibraheem, is to worship Allah alone; making the Religion sincerely for
        Him.Allah has ordered everyone with this and He has created them because
        of it. Allah, the Most High, says: {I did not create jinn and mankind
        except to worship Me} [51:56]. The meaning of worship is to single Allah
        out with all worship
      </h3>
      <h3>
        The meaning of worship is to single Allah out with all worship. (2) The
        greatest matter which Allah has ordered with is Tawheed; which is to
        single out Allah with all worship. The most severe matter which He
        forbade is shirk; which is to invoke others along with Him or besides
        Him. The proof is His saying, the Most High: {Worship Allah and do not
        associate anything with Him} [04:36]
